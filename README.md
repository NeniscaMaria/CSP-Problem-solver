# CSP-Problem-solver

In this project, we solve the Cryptarithmetic puzzle and the Zebra puzzle using CSP. The implementation was written in Java, and a custom implementation for the CSP representation was written.

For both problems we implemented a basic backtracking algorithm (BT), a forward-checking backtracking algorithm (FC-BT), and an AC3 + FC-BT algorithm (AC3-FC-BT).

More information about the solution and the problem can be found in 'documentation.pdf'.
